Authentication via the token occurs via frontend users. For each token, it is logged how often it was used for authentication and when it was last used.

How to create a token
---------------------

You can create the personalized token(s) in the frontend user data mask in the general tab after the password field.
The token itself is created automatically and cannot be changed. Of course, you have the option of deleting the token at any time or restricting it to a specific period of time.
